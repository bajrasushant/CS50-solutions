# A Todo App
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/45MLGMPPBgI
#### Description:
    For my Final project for CS50x I created a todo app using Flask, SQLite3 and a bit of html. Initially I tried to create it using Javascript but I couldn't save the todos. So here you are a todo web app where you can list all the todos that you need to complete during your time at CS50x and edit them as needed or mark them completed. You can also view different todos that you have completed.
    First you will need to register if you don't have an account here while registering your password must contain special symbols, capital letters in order to register(Be sure not to forget your password!)
    Then you can easily add edit and complete the todos. I have not given a todo delete option cause you can't just not complete a todo you need to complete it inorder to run it xD.

    Initially I tried to create it using Javascript but it was not successful so I used some distribution codes from CS50: Finance and its helpers functions
    Thank you!
